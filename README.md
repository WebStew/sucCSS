sucCSS
======

A simple .less CSS setup for your global cascade. You will need your own preferred .less compiler either of the following are a good bet.
I myself use LiveReload :

LiveReload : http://livereload.com/
Less PHP : http://leafo.net/lessphp/
Less JS : http://lesscss.org/

There is an optional repsonsive CSS grid thrown in however this is still very much a work in progress. Just remove the @import 'layout.less'; line within main.less 
to roll with your own / favourite grid setup.
